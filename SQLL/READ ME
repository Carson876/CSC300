TASK 5
When I was reading about how different programming languages implement deques know as double-ended queues, I noticed that they all solve the same problem in slightly different ways. For example, in C++, the STL deque is made up of blocks of arrays with a map in the middle to keep track of them. This lets you insert and remove quickly at both ends, but you also still get random access like an array. In Java, the ArrayDeque is built on top of a resizable circular array, so it’s also really efficient at adding and removing from the front and back, but you don’t get random access like you do with ArrayList. Python’s collections. deque is closer to a doubly linked list under the hood, which makes operations on both ends constant time, and it even has cool extra features like rotation. In Rust, VecDeque uses a circular buffer too, which makes it fast and cache-friendly. C# doesn’t technically have a built-in deque, but you can mimic one with a LinkedList<T>. Even though the underlying implementations are different, the idea is the same: deques are designed to be efficient at both ends. The differences mostly come down to memory layout and whether or not you can do random access. Compared to the stacks and queues we’ve been building with arrays or linked lists, deques are usually way more efficient. With arrays, removing from the front might mean shifting a bunch of elements over, and with linked lists, every node has pointer overhead and isn’t great for caching. Deques kind of combine the best of both worlds, and they avoid the expensive shifting, reduce memory overhead compared to linked lists, and usually take advantage of cache locality. That being said, I don’t think our implementations are “useless.” They’re really good for learning the basics and help us understand how these data structures actually work. Plus, in certain situations, a linked list implementation might still make sense, like when you want guaranteed O(1) operations without worrying about amortized resizing, or if you need to manipulate nodes directly. So, overall, I’d say built-in deques are the way to go for most real-world coding, but rolling our own stack or queue is still important for education and sometimes even for very specific use cases.
